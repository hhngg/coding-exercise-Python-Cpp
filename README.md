- Q1
Write a recursive function called AddPos that take in an array of integers intarr and an integer parameter size that holds the number of values in intarr. The function sums up all positive values in intarr and return it. For example AddPos ({-1, 1, -1, 1, -1}, 5) returns 2 (1+1).

- Q2
Write a function Join that take in 2 string parameters called str1 and str2 and an integer parameter p. If p==0, the function returns a string with str1 followed by str2 otherwise the function returns with str2 followed by str1. For examples, 
Join ("ABC", "DEF", 0) returns "ABCDEF" and Join ("ABC", "DEF", 1) returns "DEFABC".

- Q3 
Write a program that prints out the calls for a spaceship that is about to launch. Countdown the numbers from 10 to 1 and then write “Liftoff.”

- Q4
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

- Q5 
Write a function CountRangeChars that take in a string parameter str, and 2
integer parameters start and end and a character parameter ch. The function counts the number of characters that are the same as ch that fall in the range of start and end and return it. For example, CountRangeChars ("AAABBBCCC", 2, 7, 'C') returns 2 as there are 2 'C' characters between positions 2 and 7.

- Q6
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.  You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

- Q7
 Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays. 
 The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

- Q8
Provide a program to calculate f(x) = 1x2x3x...x(n-1)x(n) using resursive function
